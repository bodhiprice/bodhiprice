### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm John Price, although I often go by my middle name, Bodhi. Iâ€™m tech lead and cloud engineer at George Lucas Educational Foundation. Over the past few years my primary focus has been designing and building serverless applications on AWS using Node.js. I also have a budding passion for blockchain and crypto.

If you want to chat about getting started with AWS â€” and serverless in particular â€” please reach out. I have a ton of experience in this area and would be happy to share! You can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bodhiprice) or email me at [bodhi@fastmail.com](mailto:bodhi@fastmail.com).
